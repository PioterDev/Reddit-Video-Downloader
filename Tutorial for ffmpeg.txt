1. Go to https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases
2. Locate the latest build
3. Download "ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip"
4. Extract the zip file
5. Go to the zipfolder/bin and move ffmpeg.exe to the script directory 
OR extract only bin/ffmpeg.exe to the script directory (it doesn't matter, 2nd method will save some time tho)

5.5 If you want to, you can move it to PATH directory (like C:\Windows\System32) for some other uses, but it requires administrator

You have to do this manually because there is no way the script would do all of this automatically,
and uploading ffmpeg with the package is pointless.
