# reddit-video-downloader-master
Lets you download videos directly from Reddit with a shell command.

# Requirements
- Node.js
- ffmpeg (moving file into PATH directory is necessary)

# How it works
Before doing anything, you must "install" the script on your computer. To do this, run `node setup.js` with administrator permissions.

After you've installed it, open your command prompt and type `reddit-download [link to the reddit post with video]`

Currently, only Windows system is supported. I will add support for Linux and MacOS later.
