# Reddit-Video-Downloader
Lets you download videos directly from Reddit with a shell command.

# Requirements
- Node.js
- ffmpeg

# How it works
If you don't want to set up this permanently or don't have admin permission on your computer, run `node portable.js`. This will install a portable version, meaning you can only run it from the folder with the files.

But for comfort, I recommend installing the script on your computer. To do this, run `setup.bat` with administrator permissions.


After you've installed it, open your command prompt and type `reddit-download [link to the reddit post with video]`.

Currently, only Windows system is supported. I will add support for Linux and MacOS later.
